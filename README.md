A native iOS app that allows users to browse recipes using the following API:
https://themealdb.com/api.php

There are 2 endpoints that your app utilizes:
https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert for fetching the list of meals in the Dessert category.
https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID

I hope you find this helpful!
